# DIP: The Dependency Inversion Principle

# (2017) The most flexible systems are those in whichsource code
# dependencies refer only to abstractions, not to concretions.

# (2002)
# A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
# Both should depend on abstractions.
# B. Abstractions should not depend upon details.
# Details should depend upon abstractions

# (2000) Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
